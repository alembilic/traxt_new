                    <strong>6. Cookies</strong><br />
                    6.1 Technical or functional cookies<br />
                    <br />
                    Some cookies ensure that certain parts of the website work properly and that your user preferences remain known. By placing functional cookies, we make it easier for you to visit our website. This way, you do not need to repeatedly enter the same information when visiting our website and, for example, the items remain in your shopping cart until you have paid. We may place these cookies without your consent.<br />
                    <br />
                    6.2 Analytical cookies<br />
                    <br />
                    We use analytical cookies to optimize the website experience for our users. With these analytical cookies we get insights in the usage of our website. We ask your permission to place analytical cookies.<br />

                    6.3 Advertising cookies<br />
                    <br />
                    On this website we use advertising cookies, enabling us to personalize the advertisements for you, and we (and third parties) gain insights into the campaign results. This happens based on a profile we create based on your click and surfing on and outside https://traxr.net. With these cookies you, as website visitor are linked to a unique ID, so you do not see the same ad more than once for example.<br />

These buttons work using pieces of code coming from Facebook and LinkedIn themselves. This code places cookies. These social media buttons also can store and process certain information, so a personalized advertisement can be shown to you.<br />
                    <br />
                    Please read the privacy statement of these social networks (which can change regularly) to read what they do with your (personal) data which they process using these cookies.
