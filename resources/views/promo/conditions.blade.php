You should look at the terms regularly. We'll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than seven days after they are posted.

If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue use of Service.<br />
                    <br />
                    These terms control the relationship between Traxr and you. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.<br />
                    <br />
                    If you do not comply with these terms, and we don't take action right away, this doesn't mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in future).<br />
                    <br />
                    If any of these Terms and Conditions are rendered invalid or void, the other Terms and Conditions will remain in fact.<br />
